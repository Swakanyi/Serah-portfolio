        <p>I am currently pursuing a Certificate in Softare Engineering, where am focused on learning full-stack development, writing clean code and solving real world problems through software. I originally earned my Bachelor's degree in Economics, where i developed a strong analytical mindset and a deep appreciation for data and systems. After a few years exploring that world, i found myself increasingly drawn to technology; not just as a tool, but as a space where creativity, logic and problem-solving. So, here I am.. I made the leap.</p>
