        <p>Outside of code and learning software engineering, i genuinely enjoy tackling new challenges  and playing around with new ideas. Whether its picking up a new framework, reading a new book or trying out a new online course. I'm always looking for ways to grow and sharpen my skills. When I need to catch a break, long walks and great coffee do the magic. Call it, finding peace in the quiet moments or rewatching my favorite tutorials.</p>

        <p>My hobbies reflect how I approach life and work, that is curiosity, intention and love for learning. They bring fresh energy into anything i do.</p>
